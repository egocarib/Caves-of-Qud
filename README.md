# QudUX
This is a fork of [QudUX-2](https://github.com/egocarib/CavesOfQud-QudUX-v2?tab=readme-ov-file) by Egocarib, I am slowly going through errors the game encounters when trying to load the original mod. When it is done, I'll either do a merge request on the original repo or push this project on steam workshop

See the readme of the [original repo](https://github.com/egocarib/CavesOfQud-QudUX-v2?tab=readme-ov-file) for informations about the mod
